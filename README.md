# Mouvement-Detection
This is a project, done by 3rd year students, that I had the pleasure to supervise and guide. I am particularly proud of them. They are Arthur Bargas (@Arthurb94),Mounir Khettou (@Mounir-kht),  Quentin Lebouc (quentin.lebouc@edu.esiee.fr) and  Antoine Tchao (antoine.tchao@edu.esiee.fr).
